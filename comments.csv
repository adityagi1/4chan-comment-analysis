Some are good, some are bad, some are a mix. But the good ones don’t ever want to organize; the bad ones tend to organize because they lust after power. Powerful consciousnesses don’t want to dominate other people, they want to empower them, so they don’t tend to get together, until things are really late in the game. Then they come together and evil’s always defeated, because good is so much stronger. We’re on this planet and Einstein’s physics show and Max Planck’s physics’ show that there are at least 12 dimensions. And now that’s what all the top scientists and billionaires are coming out saying, ‘it’s a false hologram—it is artificial.’ The computers are scanning it and finding tension points where it’s artificially projected, and gravity’s bleeding-in to this universe. That’s what they call ‘dark matter’. There’s this sub-transmission zone below the 3rd dimension that just turned over the most horrible things—it’s what it resonates to. And it’s trying to get up into the 3rd dimension—that’s just a basic level consciousness—to launch into the next levels. And our species is already way up at the 5th/6th dimension, consciousining (sic) our best people. But there’s this big war trying to basically destroy humanity, because humanity has free will. And there’s a decision to which level we want to go to. We have free will, so evil’s allowed to come and contend, and not just good. Which is kinda like a false transmission, because what they’re thinking is that they are is ugly and bad, projecting it onto themselves, instead of believing ‘no, it’s a human test about building us up.’"

So all of our thoughts go into it. And we’re actually building a computer that has real neurons in real-time that’s also psychically connected to us, that are organic creatures, so that they will have current prediction powers, future prediction powers, a true crystal ball, but the big secret is: Once you have a crystal ball and know the future, you can add stimuli before-hand that make decisions that control the future, and so then it’s the end of consciousness and free will for individuals as we know, and a true 2.0 (and a very bad way) hive-mind consciousness with an AI jacked-into everyone, knowing our hopes and dreams, delivering it to us, not in some PKD wire-head system where we plug in and give up on consciousness because of unlimited pleasure, but because we were already wired-in and absorbed before we knew it by giving over our consciousness to the system, our daily decisions—that it was able to manipulate and control into a larger system. There’s now a human counter-strike taking place, to shut this off before it gets fully into place, and to block these systems and to try to have an actual debate about where humanity goes, and cut-off the pedophiles and psychic vampires that are in control of this AI system before humanity’s destroyed."

It seems that from 2009 onwards, we have had a ton of prominent trackers close, with few springing up to take their place. It started with TTi and those Nordic sites, which chose to either shut down or restrict operations when Sweden became a less friendly place for filesharing, and as the end of that year approached, we saw ScT, UK-T and FTWR disappear, almost within the same month.<br><br>Ever since, at least a couple of major players have fallen every year, the latest examples being GFT, SCC, What.cd and BCG. Of course, it&#039;s not like no tracker had ever shut down before (OiNK, EliteTorrents, SuprNova), but it happened much less often, and with alternatives always appearing to fill the void. Now it&#039;s the opposite.<br><br>Let&#039;s see if you remember these names:<br>ScT / SceneTorrents<br>SCC / SceneAccess<br>UK-T<br>FTWR / Follow The White Rabbit<br>What.cd<br>GFT / GeForces Tracker<br>FTN / FeedTheNet<br>TorrentVault<br>TorrentShack<br>ScL / SceneLife<br>BCG / Blackcats Games<br>BitGamer, Underground-Gamer<br>FreshOn.TV (a.k.a.

I’ll let your whimpering or your moans of delight give me the answer I’m looking for. When I rape you."

His lawyer, who was also representing suspected predators Thomas Moffett and Brian Gosselin, attacked Perverted Justice&#039;s methods of gathering evidence and requested the chatlogs direct from their hard drives. Perverted Justice refused to hand them over and after a court order for them to turn the hard drives over, PJ founder Xavier von Erck said the drives had crashed and were destroyed. Due to this, the three defendants walked. This was a tremendous stroke of good luck for the predator because he had confessed his intentions to the police before retaining a lawyer.

The fresh smell is incredible, an inviting combination of fruit, grass, and spices. Possibly the best smelling dry leaf I have ever sniffed. Unfortunately, I was less impressed with the flavor. It seemed to lose that fabulous complexity in the cup, turning into a satisfying but simple cup of sencha with a pleasant fruity aftertaste. Still objectively excellent tea, and I’ll try adjusting my brewing parameters to preserve more of the notes, but I’m more excited to try Ippodo’s asamushi shincha when it arrives hopefully in June."

It&#039;s a bad thing. <br>There are excellent wings everywhere, and basic sports bars and wings+beer restaurants are everywhere, and their food is miles better in the last two decades, so supporting something that supports too much of the flesh is meat and superficiality like that is a bit over the top politically incorrect now. It&#039;s like being part of the problem. Go dine where the food is excellent, the seats are comfortable, the TV coverage is standard, and where everyone would feel comfortable.<br>At my barber shop, the longest line is the female barber. Dudes like to be dotted upon, and suck that up. Strippers know how to really work that angle. Don&#039;t be a needy schlump where everyone can see that chip on your shoulder by acting like nothing is wrong with it all."

There will be problems caused in part by the natural progression of male and female desire, but these problems will be surmountable, by willpower if by nothing else.<br>The pedophile will not be able to do such a thing, because his attraction is exclusively for prepubescents. His wife will eventually permanently develop into a being for which he can feel neither love nor attraction. His desires will be left completely unsated, and he will feel compelled to predate on either his own children or those of others. Regardless of what decision he makes at that point, he will end up on an endless treadmill, because no prepubescent will be able to satisfy him for more than a limited period of time. <br>The former situation is a positive good and carries little chance for serious harm to the social order. Even if the normal man finds strict monogamy impossible, prostitution exists as a limited and regulated outlet that consumes a small and finite number of women. The damage can be kept limited. The damage dealt by the latter situation, however, is limited only by the size of the pedophile population. Such men are little interested in householding, except as a convenient cover for their activities, and can and will gobble up, ruin, and destroy as many children as they are allowed to. And, as we all know, children who have been so despoiled have serious problems functioning normally later in life. They often become sexual deviants. The greater the population of sexual deviants, the greater the burden on society as a whole and the smaller the pool of healthy mates available for selection by men and women... and so on and so forth.<br>Essentially, pedophiles undermine the sexual order, and are downright parasitic in that they prey on children while having little interest in producing any of their own. Their desires are not only unnatural, but cannot be channeled in any positive direction. The best we can hope to do without killing them is confine them to viewing cartoon drawings on Norwegian underwater basketweaving forums like this.<br>On the other hand, there is no positive argument for accepting pedophiles other than &quot;BUT IT DOESN&#039;T AFFECT YOU,&quot; &quot;LOVE IS LOVE,&quot; &quot;IF THEY WANNA FUCK KIDS, WHO&#039;S TO SAY THEY CAN&#039;T?&quot; and other forms of liberal sophistry.

RATHER THAN DEVELOPING PROCEDURES TO ASSESS MENS REA IN CHILDREN, LEGISLATURES (VIA STATUTORY LAW) AND JUDGES (VIA CASE LAW) HAVE ATTEMPTED TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS BY DEVELOPING LEGAL PROTECTIONS FOR JUVENILES. THE PREVAILING RULE IS THAT ALL CHILDREN UNDER AGE 7 ARE INCAPABLE OF COMMITTING A CRIME BECAUSE THEY CANNOT FORMULATE THE APPROPRIATE MENS REA (UNDERSTANDING OF THE REASONABLE AND PROBABLE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTIONS). FOR PERSONS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 7 AND 14, THE PRESUMPTION OF NO MENS REA IS REBUTTABLE. PERSONS 14 YEARS AND OLDER ARE TREATED AS ADULTS WITH REGARD TO MENS REA. A REVIEW OF HISTORY, STATUTES, AND CASE LAW PERTAINING TO JUVENILE MENS REA SUGGESTS THAT THE KEY ELEMENT UNDERLYING A COURT&#039;S INQUIRY INTO MENS REA IS THE CHILD&#039;S INTENT TO COMMIT THE ACT. THE STUDY OF INTENTIONALITY AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN CHILDREN IS NOT NEW TO PSYCHOLOGY. A REVIEW OF PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH INTO THE AGES AT WHICH CHILDREN DISTINGUISH BETWEEN ACCIDENTAL AND INTENTIONAL ACTS AND BEGIN TO SHOW GREATER CONCERN FOR INTENT THAN FOR CONSEQUENCES PROVIDES NO SUPPORT FOR THE IRREBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION OF NO MENS REA IN CHILDREN UNDER 7 YEARS OF AGE. RESEARCH FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE LOWER AGE LIMIT FOR IRREBUTABLE PRESUMPTION OF NO MENS REA SHOULD BE ABOLISHED OR LOWERED TO AGE 4. THE PREVAILING RULE&#039;S TWO OTHER AGE DIVISIONS DO CONFORM TO THE RESULTS OF MORAL DEVELOPMENT STUDIES IN CHILDREN. A TEST FOR ASSESSING MENS REA IN CHILDREN CLEARLY IS NEEDED. THE STORY PAIR TECHNIQUE--PRESENTING A CHILD WITH SHORT STORIES IN WHICH THE CHARACTER ACTS EITHER INTENTIONALLY OR ACCIDENTALLY AND ASKING THE CHILD TO DETERMINE WHICH CHARACTER IS NAUGHTIER--COULD BE USED TO DEVELOP SUCH A TEST.

You simply don&#039;t notice these trends.<br><br>A system of beliefs of a modern “secular” person is no less amusing than that of a so-called stupid middle age peasant. According to it, history is somehow guided in the “progressive” direction, and, therefore, modern times can only be perfect compared to everything that has been, and everything that is new (or called progressive) is good. Human&#039;s life is also a travel on the road to “success”. Everything has rational explanation, simple or complex. Everything that doesn&#039;t fit is an error, dead end, malfunction, and should be promptly excluded from mental processes (violence, suffering, death, all those “depressive” things). Real life errors should put in order, and some independent entity called state somehow guarantees that order by itself (now that&#039;s just a divine power of kings). Hardships are temporary, the way of life isn&#039;t questioned, and entertainment is a drug instead of a mirror.<br><br>Still, people rape kids. People rape grown ups. People have sex to get resources. People have sex to get resources, and everyone calls it “a relationship”. People cheat. People have sex and reenact porn scenes, for fuck&#039;s sake, and so on, and so on. But, supposedly, everything “consensual” is OK (spice it with some libertarian bullshit about “their own fault” if you like). A webcam girl under 18 is an exploited child and a crime against humanity, and if she&#039;s over 18, and is streaming to the very same people, she&#039;s a web entrepreneur who is bold about her sexuality. Sorry, I won&#039;t trust anyone who can think like that.<br><br>Another problem of morals founded on rational (utilitarian, one might say) explanations and law enforcement is that they get deactivated if no one finds out (see “Crime and Punishment”, “Three Billboards…”). What would you do to someone else on a visit to far away island? What if you are very rich, and can effectively hush everyone? Let&#039;s say we have human clones in the future, how would we treat them? “Making the world a better place” and “doing the right thing” only in certain cases is hypocrisy.

Therefore, you can predict that any egg you throw in the future will break. No mathematically-precise knowledge of physics is needed for this. Such knowledge simply increases predictive power.

But if they were to, what would that mean. More importantly. What causes our universe to have the precise set of physical laws that it does? Why does it have any physical laws at all. If nothing existed, then there would be no physical laws. But something exists, and it does. Is there an equal-and-opposite universe whose physical laws balance and compliment our own? It would seem to make sense. The question for why there is something rather than nothing seems to be answered when we consider that everything which exists is the void expressing itself in terms of what it is not. The void abides. The void is eternal. Nothingness lasts. Somethingness decays back into nothingness. The void is real. The matter is fake. Matter is maya. The void is Brahman. Perceived truth is only a temporary consistency of outcomes, and that consistency of outcomes is so very temporary against the face of eternity. The real truth is that there is no truth, and that nothing lasts forever. The void lasts forever. Simple. Succinct.
