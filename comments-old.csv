By using extremely wide bandwidth signal as well as a range of both ultra-low and high frequency sweeps, the Vidar stresses the conductors, neutralizes charges, improves the way that signals pass through metal and ultrasonically conditions the surface of the conductors.

The kind of person who thinks parents of previous generations just passively let the media and the schools raise their kids for them are the victims of the very malady they&#039;re complaining about. Parents of past generations controlled the off switch on the TV, enforced bedtimes, and talked to their kids. If they found the kid was being taught pozzed shit, they went to the school and demanded answers. Sure it&#039;s harder now, but have you ever heard of home-schooling?

In fact Ornella, you really had the impression that you knew me so you think you&#039;re just messing around with a friend, but the reality is that we are not friends. No, the reality is that I have two Oscar nominations and you have two videos on your YouTube account. I&#039;ve made films with Scorese and Tarantino and you, you&#039;ve made an advert for Spontex, a company that specializes in making cleaning products. You might think that this stung, that you&#039;ve left a lasting impression. But the truth is that you&#039;re just another whore in a long line of whores that mocked me. I&#039;m used to it. It&#039;s like living near a highway and hearing vehicles roar past your window, your senses get dulled to it. What once was a source of substantial discontent now barely even registers. But you - you Ornella, will always be stuck here. Perched in this, well maybe not by french standards but still, small studio, talking about banal celebrity gossip. I know that you wanted to be an actress Ornella, to sit where I&#039;m sitting, interviewed by some bimbo about your role in a stupid fucking flick you starred in, obligated by your contract to go on these endless soul-draining press junkets. But you&#039;re not, Ornella. You&#039;re not. And you never will be. You&#039;re in your 30s now, acting just isn&#039;t a career where women like you hit it big when they reach that age, you&#039;d need some serious acting chops to get anyone to take a chance on you and even then it&#039;s one in a million. Not to mention that the french acting scene isn&#039;t internationally relevant outside of cinephiles circles, you&#039;d have to learn English to stand a chance and let&#039;s face it, you frogs are, for whatever reason, incapable of learning more than one language. Your existence disappoints me and your words only make me pity you. The age of the funny whore is over."

That&#039;s the actual issue here. If the guys who did Airplane! decided that they wanted to do a pro abortion movie back in the 80s it would have absolutely had &#039;propaganda&#039; shoved into it but still would have been hilarious to the point that you could ignore the political sentiments and appreciate the movie for its jokes.<br><br>The idea that comedy cannot be &#039;safe&#039; is retarded.

Seriously religious women ( Christian, Muslim etc ) will wait until marriage unironically. However it is also true that in the West they are rare.A regular Western girl will usually have slept with anywhere from 4-6 guys by the time she is 24ish. There are multiple studies that show a strong correlation between the number of women&#039;s sexual premarital partners and divorce. Mental illness is also the single strongest indicator of promiscuity, take that as you will.<br><br>Realistically if you want a happy marriage with a 90% success chance you need to: <br><br>1) Wait until you find a virgin, which may be easier if you are willing to convert to whatever religion is in your area with a strong sense of community. <br>2) marry a non religious girl who is a virgin at marriage or virgin before meeting you, realistically unless you meet her at like 16-18 ( 18 is pushing it if she isn&#039;t religious ) this won&#039;t happen.<br><br>Alternatively you could also just understand that you don&#039;t need a woman to make you happy and lead a fulfilled life. The idea of true love is a childish fantasy anyway, love is a choice and when you have a culture that promotes childlike fantasies and has no fault divorce it is dangerous. If I meet the right girl I will marry her, if I change my current stance I will unironically faster convert to Islam or Mormonism before I marry a girl who has had partners before me. It does sound bleak at first but it is data driven reality. You will accept it over time if you want to be a man and face reality, or you&#039;ll settle for a used up whore and most likely suffer a life breaking divorce."

No New Republic, no thriving new Jedi Order, no third faction like the Whills, no interesting take on post-Empire/Sith villains that are less powerful but grimey, brutalist, zealous, and even more brutal. Honestly, when writing that damn Raven conflict the idea popped into my head to largely have the conceit of the new trilogy being something to do with the Force becoming unstable. As if the galaxy is essentially living on borrowed time and there&#039;s some Matrix-style reset of creation itself incoming, which is what these various factions are attempting to stop but with the villains realising this periodic instability in the force is something they can hijack to reshape creation to their whim. Call it shit if you want but at least it&#039;s not a fucking rehash of empire vs. rebels that basically undoes all the achievements of the OT and means Leia, Luke, and Han ultimately ended up living sad, pathetic lives that ended in failure and required some bint with a xenomorph set of teeth to salvage their legacies."

Again, there&#039;s an idea to put into sequel trilogy with big stakes. It could be the Star Wars equivalent of the Rohirrim arriving at the Pelennor Fields, and having various factions involved gives the story a sense of scale. The new trilogy felt like the galaxy had no depth whatsoever. One of the strengths of the prequel era (for all of its flaws) is that it feels big and deep, and you can at least forgive the OT for not having this sense of size both because it was the origins of the SW universe and it was in an era where the Empire ruled with an iron first and squashed many bit players and tertiary powers (like the Mandalorians). A sequel trilogy was the time to go big but the creatively bankrupt architects of nu-Wars pussied out big time."

They want to reduce the number of animals who have to endure horrific experiences living in cramped conditions and being slaughtered at a young age.<br>Many people implicitly or explicitly believe that what&#039;s natural is good. Vegans reject this moral framework when it&#039;s used to defend omnivorism on the grounds that humans are naturally omnivorous. Yet, animal-rights advocates are not always so quick to reject the appeal to nature when it comes to wild-animal suffering. Many of them are environmentalists; they harbor the false assumption that animals are happy in the wild, and would therefore support habitat preservation.<br>Nature is not optimized for compassion; it&#039;s optimized by the cold, harsh forces of evolution. Billions of wild vertebrates and quadrillions of wild invertebrates are suffering right now across the globe. This is an urgent tragedy.<br>Some insect species have life expectancies at birth measured in days or weeks, and most deaths are quite painful. It seems likely that wild animals as a whole experience more suffering than happiness, in which case we would hope to prevent their births, just like vegans want to prevent the births of factory-farmed animals.<br>80% of Amazon deforestation stems from cattle ranching. Given that rainforests are home to some of the highest densities of wild-animal populations (and hence wild-animal suffering) on Earth, this appears to be a consideration in favor of beef consumption.<br>When cattle eat vegetation on pasture fields, they presumably leave less vegetation left over to be eaten by bugs (and other organisms). Hence, cattle grazing on the whole reduces bug populations (and therefore, bug suffering) on pasture fields."

One summer I worked on a farm that did mixed organic and ‘conventional’ farming of a variety of crops and livestock. One organic fertilizer we would use for green beans was blood from the killing floor. They’d drive a tanker truck out to the field and we’d pump it through the sprinkler heads. Occasionally bits of brain or tissue would get stuck in the heads and you’d have to clear them by hand. In about an hour the truck would be empty and we’d flush the lines with water. By the end you’d be covered in pig blood. I often thought of the vegans and muslims that would feel so good about eating their pork blood beans."

Regardless of what decision he makes at that point, he will end up on an endless treadmill, because no prepubescent will be able to satisfy him for more than a limited period of time. <br>The former situation is a positive good and carries little chance for serious harm to the social order. Even if the normal man finds strict monogamy impossible, prostitution exists as a limited and regulated outlet that consumes a small and finite number of women. The damage can be kept limited. The damage dealt by the latter situation, however, is limited only by the size of the pedophile population. Such men are little interested in householding, except as a convenient cover for their activities, and can and will gobble up, ruin, and destroy as many children as they are allowed to. And, as we all know, children who have been so despoiled have serious problems functioning normally later in life. They often become sexual deviants. The greater the population of sexual deviants, the greater the burden on society as a whole and the smaller the pool of healthy mates available for selection by men and women... and so on and so forth.<br>Essentially, pedophiles undermine the sexual order, and are downright parasitic in that they prey on children while having little interest in producing any of their own. Their desires are not only unnatural, but cannot be channeled in any positive direction. The best we can hope to do without killing them is confine them to viewing cartoon drawings on Norwegian underwater basketweaving forums like this.<br>On the other hand, there is no positive argument for accepting pedophiles other than &quot;BUT IT DOESN&#039;T AFFECT YOU,&quot; &quot;LOVE IS LOVE,&quot; &quot;IF THEY WANNA FUCK KIDS, WHO&#039;S TO SAY THEY CAN&#039;T?&quot; and other forms of liberal sophistry.

I remember trying to read a book of his when i was around 14-17 years old, because I suffered from severe clinical depression and tried to get back into reading. Recommended by a long gone friend. It was a story about Death retireing and then zombies just appeared, or something. I got bored really quickly and while some parts were interesting, most of the other stuff was annoyingly to read. I dropped the book and forgot about the author. Anyways, I shared my experiences with my friend and she basically turned the friendly discussion into a heated argument, because Pratchett is great social commentary, satire and absoluletly hilarious. Turns out a lot of people i know seem to adore this man (or his books, that wasnt clear) and I felt like a literature outcast, getting called a humorless asshole and things like that. Just because i dont worship a certain author. Well, i gave them the benefit of the doubt and started reading &quot;The Colour of magic&quot;. Halfway through, it seems like a wholesome, easy read to relax with funny ideas and names, weirdly written cuts between scenes and generic fantasy elements with some twists in it. Meanwhile I looked up Pratchetts reception on the internet and it seems to me at last, that there are rarely if none negative views on his works, just &quot;Its the best, period&quot; without any explanation and if negative views come to light, the pitchforks and torches come out and the hunt begins.<br><br>So in short, how did that happen? Is this the case of &quot;Read 20 books then you get it&quot;-kind of thing, or do i miss something? I just want some civil opinions, or something similar."
