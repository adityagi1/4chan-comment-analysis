# SpectrumLabs Data Science Interview Project - Aditya Tyagi

This repository contains my analysis for the SpectrumLabs 4chan analysis project.

## Objective: Predict board membership for each 4chan comment using text content
## Dataset: Obtained via 4chan API

## Organization:
- ### STEP 1: Extraction Cleaning
- ### STEP 2: Exploratory Analysis
- ### STEP 3: Disciminative Analysis
- ### STEP 4: Modelling


Instructions:
- run the jupyter notebook


NOTE: the notebook acquires live data (this takes time) and persists it into the local filesystem as comments.csv. This takes time. To ensure reproducibility, I have used
	comments-old.csv, which contains static data. You can use either comments.csv or comments-old.csv by changing the appropriate line in the code.

I hope you enjoy my analysis. :)
